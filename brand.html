                <h3>Colors</h3>
                <p>
                        The colors chosen to represent Tenacious Raccoon are not just inspired by the physical appearance of a raccoon but by it's nature and what it represents. 
                        Greens and browns were selected to represent nature and grounding, establishing a strong, earthy foundation for the Tenacious Raccoon brand. 
                        These colors create a base that is both stable and nurturing, reflecting the natural world and the raccoon's connection to it. 
                        Charcoal, representing the fur of the raccoon, was chosen for its versatility and adaptability, mirroring the raccoon's ability to thrive in diverse environments. 
                        The background color, a greenish-gray, serves as the canvas for the entire page. This hue is subtle, soft, muted, and calming, providing a peaceful backdrop that allows 
                        other elements to stand out without overwhelming the viewer.

                        Dark brown is used for emphasized areas such as the navigation bar and headings. 
                        This color is grounded, bold, and determined, but it maintains a quiet strength, avoiding the need to be overly loud or brash. 
                        Finally, rustic orange is chosen to accent key features, adding a pop of color that injects energy and creativity into the design. 
                        This warm, vibrant hue contrasts beautifully with the more subdued tones, symbolizing innovation and the spark of creativity that drives the Tenacious Raccoon brand.
